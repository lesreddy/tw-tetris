[Totally Wild Tetris](https://lesreddy.github.io/tw-tetris/) is a colourful animal themed version of the classic brick building game that was first released back in [1984!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) 
Features include 10 levels, a realtime score, level and time update all designed in a simple and colourful way.  As a beginner developer the main purpose of this project was to improve my skills in Javascript which whilst I enjoy I currently find very challenging!

## Applied Technologies

The following technologies were used to construct the site:

1. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. 
2. [Bootstrap](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) - used to simplify the structure and to make it responsive.
3. [jquery](https://www.jquery.com) - a required library for Bootbox.
4. [Bootbox](http://bootboxjs.com/) - a small JavaScript library which allows you to create programmatic dialog boxes using Bootstrap modals, without having to worry about creating, managing, or removing any of the required DOM elements or JavaScript event handlers.
5. [SweetAlert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) - A JS library for running stylistically improved JS popup boxes
6. [PopperJS](https://popper.js.org/) - also a required JS library to run Bootbox

[Tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) was used to compress images from high res state to maintain quality.

[MS Paint](https://ms-paint.en.softonic.com/) was also used to re-size images down for implementing onto [ImgBB](https://imgbb.com) for this readme file.
