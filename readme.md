[Totally Wild Tetris](https://lesreddy.github.io/tw-tetris/) is a colourful animal themed version of the classic brick building game that was first released back in [1984!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) 
Features include 10 levels, a realtime score, level and time update all designed in a simple and colourful way.  As a beginner developer the main purpose of this project was to improve my skills in Javascript which whilst I enjoy I currently find very challenging!

## UX


### Goals

The primary purpose was to build a game with as much Javascript as possible to expediate the developers (a beginner) learning of it.

### User Stories

1. The game to look as much like a real tetris game as possible.

2.  Ensure that there was a bulk of it made with pure Javascript.

3.  Easy to use with clear menus and instructions.

4.  Small fun learning component to it.

5.  Bright and colourful to resonate and reiterate the fun nature of the game.

6.  Appropriate background music that can be switched on and off.

### Design

**Fonts**

Primary font chosen was **Permanent Marker** to give a jungle feel to the game and ensure a fun theme is created.

Secondary font was **Varela** which contrasts well with the primary choice of font but also allows a clearer 

### Wireframes

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/JQ5LJHzOdLoZvROewrwEzDgW/Totally-Wild-Tetris?node-id=14%3A76) was used to create the wireframes. 


## Features

### Existing Features

1.  10 Different Levels:  As the player reaches 500 points then a new level will be shown by the background changing

2.  Set Player Name:  When you click on this button you can set the name of the player

3.  Reset Game:  When this is clicked you can start a new game

4.  Level displayed onscreen as the bacground changes.

5.  Score displayed onscreen when the player creates a new line.

6.  Pop up Modal which tells you which level you reached with a fun fact inside.

### Remaining Features to Create

1. High Score Table storing the top 5 scores with corresponding name

2. About screen which gives basic details on the game and how you reach a different level each time you reach 500 points

3. Audio - background music and also sound when the blocks hit each other

4. Include some fontawesome icons to improve the styling of the game.

## Applied Technologies

The following technologies were used to construct the site:

1. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. 
2. [Bootstrap](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) - used to simplify the structure and to make it responsive.
3. [jquery](https://www.jquery.com) - a required library for Bootbox.
4. [PopperJS](https://popper.js.org/) - also a required JS library to run Bootbox


## Testing

Tested on Chrome and Safari and the game works 

Responsive tested mainly through Chrome Developer tools.

### Validation

* Ran [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate the css file and also [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate the html markup.

### Client Stories

1. The game to look as much like a real tetris game as possible.

This is achieved and the player can immediately tell this when the game is launched

2.  Ensure that there was a bulk of it made with pure Javascript.

This is the case as the actual game mechanics was built using vanilla javascript, however jquery is used throughout.

3.  Easy to use with clear menus and instructions.

This could be better as there is currently no about screen but the simple nature of it means that it quite easy to use on larger screens and any device with a keyboard.

4.  Small fun learning component to it.

This is not really achieved yet as currently the fun fact only shows up once for level 1.

5.  Bright and colourful to resonate and reiterate the fun nature of the game.

This is achieved with the typography and colorful nature of the game.

6.  Appropriate background music that can be switched on and off.

This is not yet achieved.

### Manual

### Bugs

The major flaw with the game is that it only works with a keyboard so on smaller screens its basically redundant.

Currently I cannot get the name to store on the screen.

I also cannot get the fun fact to change for each level.

Also I cannot implement a timer.

Also I had issues with changing the size of the canvas element when changing screen sizes and making the game responsive.

I believe the solution lies in this article but it was complex for me to interpret.
