[Totally Wild Tetris](https://lesreddy.github.io/tw-tetris/) is a colourful animal themed version of the classic brick building game that was first released back in [1984!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) 
Features include 10 levels, a realtime score, level and time update all designed in a simple and colourful way.  As a beginner developer the main purpose of this project was to improve my skills in Javascript which whilst I enjoy I currently find very challenging!

## UX


### Goals

The primary purpose was to build a game with as much Javascript as possible to expediate the developers (a beginner) learning of it.

### User Stories

1. The game to look as much like a real tetris game as possible.

2.  Ensure that there was a bulk of it made with pure Javascript.

3.  Easy to use with clear menus and instructions.

4.  Small fun learning component to it.

5.  Bright and colourful to resonate and reiterate the fun nature of the game.

6.  Appropriate background music that can be switched on and off.

### Design

**Fonts**

Primary font chosen was **Permanent Marker** to give a jungle feel to the game and ensure a fun theme is created.

Secondary font was **Varela** which contrasts well with the primary choice of font but also allows a clearer 

### Wireframes

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/JQ5LJHzOdLoZvROewrwEzDgW/Totally-Wild-Tetris?node-id=14%3A76) was used to create the wireframes.

## Applied Technologies

The following technologies were used to construct the site:

1. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. 
2. [Bootstrap](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) - used to simplify the structure and to make it responsive.
3. [jquery](https://www.jquery.com) - a required library for Bootbox.
4. [Bootbox](http://bootboxjs.com/) - a small JavaScript library which allows you to create programmatic dialog boxes using Bootstrap modals, without having to worry about creating, managing, or removing any of the required DOM elements or JavaScript event handlers.
5. [SweetAlert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) - A JS library for running stylistically improved JS popup boxes
6. [PopperJS](https://popper.js.org/) - also a required JS library to run Bootbox


## Testing

### Validation

### Client Stories

### Manual

### Bugs

* Ran [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate the css file and also [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate the html markup.

[Tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) was used to compress images from high res state to maintain quality.

[MS Paint](https://ms-paint.en.softonic.com/) was also used to re-size images down for implementing onto [ImgBB](https://imgbb.com) for this readme file.
